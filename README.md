# Video-control-using-hand-gestures
* We made a video control with the gestures of the hand . At the begining we used one hand for recognizing 5 moves ( pause/start , increase volume ,decrease volume , move forward , move backward ) but then optimised the code with a sliding window to detect the dominant move in order to avoid confusion in detecting many movements . We also used both hands because it enables more flexibility to the detection based on the number of fingers detected in one hand or the other and enables us to add 2 gestures which are (increase video playback speed , decrease video playback speed ).
